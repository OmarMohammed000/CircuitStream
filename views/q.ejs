    <p class="text-start">A measurement-based quantum computer is a device that uses the quantum properties of particles to perform computations.

     The most common approach to building such a system involves a series of qubits, or quantum bits, which are systems that can be in multiple states simultaneously. The goal is for the system to be in one state when its first qubit is measured and another state when its second qubit is measured. This creates a computational pattern called entanglement.
     
     Measurement-based quantum computers have many applications, but they must be able to handle error rates at least as low as those of traditional computers in order to be useful.</p>
